# My Class Notes
This repository serves as a online backup and easily shareable version of my notes from classes.
It uses [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) for the website frontend.
The notes are stored within the content folder, and the website can be accessed [here](https://jsilus.github.io/class-notes).
