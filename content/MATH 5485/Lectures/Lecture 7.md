Wrapped up [[The Bisection Method]]
Started [[Fixed-Point Iteration]] and [[Fixed-Point Theorem]]

## Example
$g(x)=\sqrt x$ has a unique fixed point on $[\frac{1}{2},2]$.

First, check $g(x)\in C[\frac{1}{2},2]$
Next, check $g(x)\in[\frac{1}{2},2]$

$g'(x)=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}>0$ for all $x\in[\frac{1}{2},2]$
$g_{min}=g(\frac{1}{2})=\frac{\sqrt2}{2}\le g(x)\le g_{max}=g(2)=\sqrt2$

Then, by the Fixed-Point Theorem, $\exists$ at lease one fixed point
