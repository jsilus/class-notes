Suppose
$\beta=\{\beta_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to zero
$\alpha=\{\alpha_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to number $\alpha$

If $\exists\kappa>0$ such that $|\alpha_{n}-\alpha|<\kappa\beta_{n}$ for $n$ large
we say $\{\alpha_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $\alpha$ with rate of convergence $O(\beta_{n})$

$\alpha_{n}=\alpha+O(\beta_{n})$
