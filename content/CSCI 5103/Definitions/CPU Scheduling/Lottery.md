- Randomized proportional-share scheduling algorithm
- Each process allotted lotteries in proportion to its weight
- Scheduling:
	- Conduct lottery
	- Lottery winner gets to run

#### Properties
- Probabilistically fair
	- Expected allocation proportional to weight
	- No guarantee on actual allocation
- Expected throughput is proportional to weight
- Expected response time is inversely proportional to weight
- No starvation
