A condition that must be true over each iteration of the loop
We then check this through induction
## Base Case / Initialization
Show that during the first iteration of the loop, the loop invariant is true.
## Induction / Maintenance
Show that if the loop invariant is true for iteration $i$, the loop invariant is true for iteration $i + 1$.
## Termination
Show that when $i=n$, the loop invariant is true.
#### Why is this step necessary?
Most important to show that the algorithm is terminating in the correct place.
**NOT** important to the loop invariant
