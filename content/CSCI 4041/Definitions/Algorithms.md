**algorithm:** computational process that takes input and produces output. Steps must be *unambiguous* and *finite* in count.
**algorithms vs functions:** algorithms must be computable

>[!tip] FOR MATH 5485
>Algorithms must be unambiguous and finite.
>We also care about algorithm [[Stability|stability]].
### Verification
1. How can we ensure **CORRECTNESS**?
	1. Induction
	2. [[Loop Invariant]]
2. How can we ensure **EFFICIENCY**?
		1. Platform independent
		3. Number of operations - **asymptotic performance**
		4. NOT literal time
