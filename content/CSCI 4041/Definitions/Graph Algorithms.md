# What is a graph?
- Data structure
- Models connectivity

## Things in graphs
- Vertical edges
- Nodes
- Connected component
- Disjoint set forest
- Vertices : things
- Edges : connection relationships

# Directed Graphs
- Each edge has a weight

### Adjacency Matrix
- $i,j$ entry corresponds to weight of edge from node $i$ to node $j$

# Adjacency List
- Linked list
- Each node has a list of all nodes it's connected to
- Like a dictionary

#  Searching Algorithms
- [[Breadth First Search]]
- [[Depth First Search]]
