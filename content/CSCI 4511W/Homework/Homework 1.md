	1. The book states this because it's possible that the agent could develop it's own strategy that works better than what was mentioned. All that matters is that it achieves the outcomes that are expected.
	2. The definition of a rational agent is "For each possible percept sequence, a rational agent should select an action that is expected to maximize its performance measure, given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever built-in knowledge the agent has." An agent isn't irrational if information it doesn't know about would have changed its action had it known about it, according to this definition. As long as they are making the best decision given their knowledge, an agent is rational.
	3. The performance measure would be encoded within the agent function. The agent function has the actions a program would take given any input. In this space, we could weight different actions so the function would be different.
