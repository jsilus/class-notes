**Theorem:** Let $A$ be an arbitrary matrix. A nonsingular matrix $U$ exists with the property that
$$
T=U^{-1}AU
$$
where $T$ is an upper triangular matrix whose diagonal entries consist of the eigenvalues of $A$

**Theorem:** The $n\times n$ matrix $A$ is symmetric if and only if there exists a diagonal matrix $D$ and an orthogonal matrix $Q$ with $A=QDQ^{\top}$

**Corollary:** Suppose $A$ is a symmetric $n\times n$ matrix. There exists $n$ eigenvectors of $A$ that forms an orthonormal set and the eigenvalues are real.
