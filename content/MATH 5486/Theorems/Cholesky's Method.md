**Theorem:** If $A$ is real, symmetric, and [[Positive Definite|positive definite]]. Then, it has a *unique* factorization such that $A=LL^{T}$ where $L$ is a lower [[Triangular Matrices|triangular matrix]].

**Fact 1:** For an upper triangular matrix, its inverse is also an upper triangular matrix. For a lower triangular matrix, its inverse is also a lower triangular matrix.
