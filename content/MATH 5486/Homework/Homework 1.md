## 1.
Note that
$$
\left[
\begin{array}{c:c}
A_{1} & A_{2} & \cdots & A_{n}
\end{array}
\right]
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
x_{1} \\ x_{2} \\ \vdots \\ x_{n}
\end{array}
\right]
=
A_{1}x_{1}+A_{2}x_{2}+\cdots+A_{n}x_{n}
=
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
b_{1} \\ b_{2} \\ \vdots \\ b_{n}
\end{array}
\right]
$$
can otherwise be phrased as $b$ is a linear combination of the column vectors of $A$. This is equivalent to saying that $b$ is within the $\text{span}(A_{1},A_{2},\dots,A_{n})$.
