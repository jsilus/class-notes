If $Av=\lambda v$, then $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue of a matrix and $v$ is the corresponding eigenvector

**Remark:** If $(\lambda,x)$ where $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue and $x$ is the corresponding eigenvector and $\alpha\ne0$ is constant,
$$
A(\alpha x)=\alpha Ax=\alpha(\lambda x)=\lambda(\alpha x)
$$
so $\alpha x$ is also an eigenvector.

It is natural that we can additionally require $\lVert x\rVert=1$.
