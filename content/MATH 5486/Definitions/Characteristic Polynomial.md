If $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$, the **characteristic polynomial** of $A$ is defined as
$$
p(\lambda)=\det(A-\lambda I)
$$
$p(\lambda)$ is an $n\text{-th}$ order polynomial. This means that $p(\lambda)=0$ has at most $n$ solutions.

If $\lambda$ is a zero of $p(\lambda)$, then $(A-\lambda I)x=0$ for some $x\ne0$..

The zeros of $p(\lambda)$ are called the [[Eigenvalue|eigenvalues]] of $A$.
