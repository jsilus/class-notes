1. In a medieval illustration of Norse cosmography, Mithgarth is situated under Asgarth. But Snorri, as follows from the master builder myth (building a wall around Asgarth), places Asgarth in the middle of Mithgarth. Do you think Snorri deliberately euhemerized eddic geography? Do we have any certainty that Snorri sometimes euhemerized the myths?
	- [[Euhemerization]]
	- [[Snorri Sturluson]]
2. In our discussion of myths, a few non-trivial terms turned up: comedia sacra, sacral marriage, theriomorphic gods, ritual drama, and, of course, myth as a charter. Don’t bother to define those concepts (the definitions can be found online in five minutes), but state very briefly where in our material those concepts are applicable and relevant.

	- [[Odin]]
3. According to Aristotle, earthquakes happen because gases in the hollow spaces within the Earth seek an escape. Some medieval scholars referred to a psalm, in which it is said that the earth trembles when God shows His displeasure with people for their sins and on such grounds rejected Aristotle’s theory. What is the explanation of earthquakes in Scandinavian myths? Can any of the three explanations be called primitive science? What would you expect from a science, however primitive?
	- [[Myth]]
	- [[Supernatural]]
4. Othin sacrificed himself to himself for obtaining a certain treasure. What did he obtain? Was the treasure worth the sacrifice?
	- [[Odin]]
5. There have been numerous attempts to piece together the gods’ biographies. Questions like—how soon after his birth did Othin suspend himself from a tree, and, if it happened in his youth, can this episode be understood as his initiation? and the like—have often been asked. What do you think of such attempts (both as related to Othin and in principle)?
	- Stories are not chronologically placed
6. How useful has etymology been for understanding the meaning and development of Scandinavian myths?
7. What are the main cases of ritual mutilation in Scandinavian myths? Which of them are easy to explain and which make little sense to us?

8. Should shamanism be mentioned in the study of Scandinavian myths, and if so, why?
	- [[Shaman]]
	- [[Seithr]]
9. It is taken for granted that Snorri and Saxo knew different versions of practically all the myths. Are their versions irreconcilable?
	- [[Snorri Sturluson]]
	- [[Saxo Grammaticus]]
10. Does the author of the note I found in a local newspaper have a clear notion of Scandinavian myths? “Walhalla, N.D. The name of this town is from Old Norse mythology and refers to the land of the gods, which Scandinavian settlers thought they had found after crossing so many miles of treeless prairie. And with its deep thickets of oak and aspen steep slopes and abundant wildlife, the gorge does provide a heavenly break from the surrounding plains.” How happy are people supposed to be in that town?
	- Valhalla is for a warrior's death?
	- Maybe not this peaceful
	- **Valhalla is NOT the land of the gods**
