1. Although some old communities could do without heroic poetry and *\[songs?\]*, no human society without myths has been discovered. What do you think is the reason for this, and what meaning do you ascribe to the word myth? Additionally, who could possibly need long catalogs of dwarfs and horses and catechism-like songs like The Speeches of Wafthurnir?
	1. [[Oral Tradition]]
	2. [[Myth]]
	3. Singers of Tales - [[Week 3]]
2. Our course is called “Scandinavian Myths,” but the texts we use have been translated from Old Icelandic. What explains this devotion to one language at the expense of Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish? Did the rest of Scandinavia know the myths preserved by Snorri and in The Poetic Edda?
	1. [[Christianization]]
	2. [[Renaissance]]
	3. [[Snorri Sturluson]]
	4. [[Tacitus]]
	5. [[Saxo Grammaticus]]
3. The creation myth is usually about the triumph of order over chaos. To what extent, in your opinion, does this statement fit the case of Scandinavian mythology?
	1. [[The Creation of the World]]
	2. Read for more
4. Our sources give more than one version of the creation myth, and it is not entirely clear how the Scandinavians thought the first human beings appeared. What are these versions (in a nutshell)? Why should there be discrepancies in such reports, and why are some of those reports so patchy?
	1. [[The Creation of the World]]
	2. Read for more
5. Who populated the eddic universe? What was the balance of power between the gods and the rest of the “multitudes” active in Scandinavian myths?
	1. [[Gods]]
	2. [[Giants]]
	3. Maybe fewer humans than other cultures like Greek myths
	4. Read for more
6. The end of the first lay of the Poetic Edda poses the vexing question about Christianity’s influence on what we believe must be a corpus of pagan myths. Such questions do not occur in the discussion of Sumerian or Greek myths (Gilgamesh, The Iliad, etc.), but they would not be out of place in dealing with The Kalevala, which was recorded in the 19th century. Why? Do you think that Snorri’s penchant for euhemerization is a factor here?
	1. [[Euhemerization]]
	2. [[Snorri Sturluson]]
	3. [[Christianization]]
	4. [[Renaissance]]
	5. Few sources for Scandinavian mythology
7. Do you think it is possible to draw a map of the eddic world? If so, what would it be like? Is it possible to give a chronological table of the events that happened in the Eddas?
	1. Myths discuss the beginning and then the end, not much of the middle
	2. Read for more
8. To what extent are we dealing with a naïve version of modern science when we read Scandinavian myths? (The same question can be asked about the myths of any country.) After all, both the story tellers of old and modern scholars pose similar questions about the origin of the universe, the appearance of the first human beings, the nature of rain, thunder, fire, and so forth.
	1. [[Supernatural]]
	2. [[Myth]]
