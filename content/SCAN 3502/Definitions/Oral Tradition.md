Generally synonymous with folklore
The only way of spreading [[Myth|myths]] pre [[Christianization]]/pre literacy.

### Alliteration
- Old poetry had no rhymes
- Alliteration was used to help memorize
### Instability
- Plot was relatively the same
- Details depended on the audience and the storyteller
- These were sung poems
	- Translation has largely lost the poetic element
##### Causes
- The shorter the myth, the less variety
- The longer the myth, the more to change
- Had to make them interesting for people to stay
### History
Much has been lost to time without any written record

- Because of the variations, we cannot know that they knew of the same details - only the name
