somewhere around 1150-1220
Was a Dane and [[Skald]]

Probably didn't read [[Snorri Sturluson]].

### Gesta Danorum
- Book authored by Saxo
- About the Kings of Denmark
- Linked them to [[Iceland|Icelandic]] [[Myth|mythology]]
- Much more [[Euhemerization]] than Snorri
	- The gods are referred to as kings

### Translates to Saxo the Grammarian
- This is because he knew Latin
- His book was in Latin
- His style is confusing
