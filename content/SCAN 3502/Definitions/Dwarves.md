Great craftsmen
Not small

Because they were craftsmen, they had great treasures. This is probably why it came to be that dwarves live in mountains. Because they were in mountains, they probably became smaller within stories. They **did not** live in mountains or mounds in Scandinavian myths, and they were certainly not small because of it.
