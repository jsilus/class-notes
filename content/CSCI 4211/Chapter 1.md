## Definitions
**Networks** are made of nodes and links
A **node** is an individual device
A **link** is the connection between nodes
**Switching** moves packets from one node to the next along a path to its destination
- Packet switching is when we transmit packets individually. UDP
- Circuit switching is when we transmit all packets at once along a circuit. TCP
Statistical **Multiplexing** is packet switching on the network to allow many hosts.
