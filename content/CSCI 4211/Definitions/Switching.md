## Packet Switching
Packet switching is when we transmit packets individually. This is UDP?

### Queueing
Queueing happens when the arrival rate of packets exceeds the transmission rate. If the queue is full, the packets are dropped. This is a source of packet loss.

## Circuit Switching
Circuit switching is when we transmit all packets at once along a circuit. This is TCP?
