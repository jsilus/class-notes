### 1945-1955: Mono-programming
- Large computers (building-size)
- Vacuum tubes
- Direct programming of hardware
- **No OS**

### 1955-1965: Batch Systems
- Punch card programs
- Results were output after a few hours
- Similar to today's supercomputers
- **Basic OS**

### 1965-1980: Multi-programming
- Multiple programs executing in parallel
- Allow more efficient use of CPU and I/O
- Time-sharing: fast time-multiplexing between multiple jobs
- OS performs resource management and control
- **MULTICS &** [[UNIX]]

### 1980- : Personal Computers
- Started as single-user systems
- Main focus: Ease of use
- Evolution of GUIs
- OS provide simple abstractions and resource management
- **DOS, Windows, MacOS, Linux, FreeBSD**

### 1985- : Distributed Systems
- A collection of independent computers that appears to its users as a single coherent system
- Multiple computers linked by a network/bus
- Variations
	- Multiprocessor systems
	- Client-server systems
	- Cloud computing

### 2000- : Mobile Computing
- Handheld and wearable devices
- Main constraints: power, size/weight
- Limited resources, many sensors
- **Android, iOS**
