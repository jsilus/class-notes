A **dominating set** of an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ is a set $U\subseteq V$ such that every $v\in V\setminus U$ has a neighbor in $U$.

**Theorem:** Let $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices, minimum degree $\delta>1$. Then, $G$ has a dominating set of at most 
$$
n \frac{1+\ln(\delta+1)}{\delta+1}\text{ vertices}
$$
