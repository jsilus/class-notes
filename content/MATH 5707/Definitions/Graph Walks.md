What I might refer to as paths
length(walk) $=$ # edges
A **closed walk** is when $x_{0}=x_{e}$.
A closed walk of length $\ge3$ where vertices do not repeat is called a **cycle**.
If vertices are allowed to repeat, it is a **circuit**.
A circuit is called **Eulerian** if it passes each edge of the graph exactly once.
###### When does a graph have an Eulerian circuit?
Each vertex needs to have an even degree
Graph must be connected
