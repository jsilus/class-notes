Two graphs are **isomorphic** if their vertices can be matched so that edges also match.
When finding if two graphs are isomorphic, their degree sequences must match.
- (necessary condition, not sufficient condition)

**Puzzle:** find two graphs that are not isomorphic with same degree sequences and 5 vertices.
- later homework problem
