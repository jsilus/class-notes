A **k-cup** is a set of points $(x_{i},h(x_{i}))$  where $i=1,\dots,k$ where $h$ is a convex function. A **k-cap** is the same thing but where $h$ is a concave function. Assume if $x_{i}\neq x_{j},i\neq j$.

**Theorem:** For $k,l\geq2$, every non degenerate set of ${k+l-4\choose k-2}+1$ points contains a k-cup or l-cap. False for ${k+l-4\choose k-2}$ points.

**Corollary:** Out of any ${2k-4\choose k-2}+1$ points, one can choose vertices of convex k-gon.
