>[!def] graph
>A graph $G$ is an ordered pair $(V,E)$ such that $E$ is a subset of set $V^{2}$

## Helpful terms
- $V$ - vertices
- $E$ - edges
- Edge $xy=\{x,y\}$ joins vertices $x$ and $y$
- If $xy\in E$, then $x,y$ are **adjacent** in $G$, $x$ and $y$ are **incident** to $xy$.
- $G'$ is a **subgraph** of $G$ if $V'\subset V,E'\subset E$.
- If all elements of $E$ in $(V')^{2}$ are in $E'$, then $G'$ is an **induced subgraph**.
- If $V'=V$, then $G'$ is a **spanning subgraph**.

## Important Classes
- [[Trees]] - connected and acyclic
- Complete - all vertices have an edge to all others
- [[Connected]] - all vertices have a path to all others
- Acyclic - no cycles can be formed
- Planar - **can be** drawn on plane without crossing edges
- Directed - does not fit our class definition of graphs
- Empty - no edges
- Bipartite - color vertices black and white such that all edges have opposite vertices
